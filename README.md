This repository contains synthetic data generated for the study titled "Enhanced Diabetes Detection and Blood Glucose Prediction Using TinyML-Integrated E-Nose and Breath Analysis: A Novel Approach Combining Synthetic and Real-World Data." The synthetic data was created using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and is intended for use in non-invasive diabetes detection research and machine learning model validation.

## Data Description
- File: diabetessynthetic.csv
- Number of Samples: 14,000
Data Fields:
- Biometrics and health metrics similar to the original dataset, including synthetic blood glucose levels, acetone concentrations, and other relevant features.
This synthetic dataset replicates the statistical characteristics of the original data, which includes biometric and health information from participants with and without diabetes mellitus.

Purpose and Usage
This dataset is provided to support research in non-invasive diabetes detection, machine learning, and TinyML applications. Researchers can use this dataset to:

Train and validate machine learning models for blood glucose prediction and diabetes detection.
Explore the potential of synthetic data in medical diagnostics.
